This project is still in the beginning stages of development. We have yet to come up with any ideas for functionality but we have came up with a logo, a style guide, a SKELETON.md template, a ROLES.md file, and a README.md file.

## Sprint 1, Week 0 (Febuary 12 - 19) - Progress Report
So far, we have completed the Figma design for the UI, and initialized the React application. We have set up the SQL database, and found APIs that could be used for our project. We also researched about the backend to understand the work and code we will need for the future.

Our plan for this week is to set up the backend. And then containerize the frontend, backend, and database, and ensure communication between all three.

## Sprint 1, Week 1 (Febuary 19 - 26) - Progress Report
Nect expected project update on the 26th
