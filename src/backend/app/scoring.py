"""
This module provides functionality to score a March Madness bracket by comparing
a userâ€™s picks with the actual results:
    - 10 points for each correct pick in the First Round
    - 20 for Second Round
    - 40 for Sweet 16
    - 80 for Elite 8
    - 160 for Final 4
    - 320 for Championship

Both the user and actual bracket JSONs can be structured in two ways:
1. A complete rounds-based bracket with a "rounds" key.
2. A region-based bracket with a "regions" key (the user bracket format).
   Note: The round "National Championship" is remapped to "Championship".
If a game in the actual bracket does not yet have a winner, no points are added.
